# VARTA-Project
 BTECH Major Project

 ## Introduction
 This is the game portion of the VARTA project. The game is a VR teaching assistant with the purpose of teaching the user how to read better.
 This game was developed in Unity using C# and the Oculus SDK. The game is designed to be played on the Oculus Quest 2, but should work on most Android based VR headsets.
 It should also work on iOS VR devices, but has not been tested. The game is designed to be played in a seated position, but can be played standing up as well.
 This game uses the Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services API to analyze the user's reading. This is done by the player reading out loud what is on the screen.
 The game will then analyze the user's reading and give them feedback on how to improve their reading. This is done by providing statistics such as the number of words read correctly, the number of words read incorrectly, and the time it took to read the full text.
 The game also provides a list of words that were read incorrectly and the correct pronunciation of those words and the spelling of those words.
 This game is meant to be used in conjuction with the launcher portion of the VARTA project. The launcher portion of the project is designed to be used by teachers to set up the game for their students.
 
 ## Installation
 The game can be installed by either downloading the source code and building the project yourself in Unity, or by downloading the prebuilt file.
 If building the game yourself, have a folder named "VARTA", or anything you like, in your Documents folder. Then create a subfolder named "Game" and build the project in that subfolder.
 The launcher can then be built in the parent folder. The launcher will look for the game in the "Game" subfolder.
 
 To run the game, you will need to plug your VR headset, preferably the Oculus Quest 2, into your computer and have the Oculus software installed.
 Then, open the executable file and the game should start up. If you are using an Oculus device, you will need to have the Oculus software installed and opened when launching.
 Then, you will need to connect your headset to your computer. The game will then launch on your headset when you press the button in the launcher with an image of a VR headset and a book on it.
 Alternatively, the game can also be launched directly with the executable file. This will launch the game normally but additional text (txt) files will not be able to be added to the game.
 
 ## Usage
 The game is designed to be used by students to improve their reading skills. The game is designed to be used in conjuction with the launcher portion of the VARTA project.
 The launcher portion of the project is designed for use by teachers to set up the game for their students. In this launcher you are able to upload text (txt) files to the game that can then be used by the students to practice reading in the practice game mode.
 Once in the game, the player will be presented with the options to either enter the story mode or the practice mode. There is also an option to quit the game here.
 The story mode is a set of three stories the player can read. These three stories follow the three act structure and are designed to be read in order.
 The practice mode is where the player can practice reading the text files that were uploaded to the game by the teacher. The player can also practice reading the pre-added short stories in the story mode.
 There are three short stories that come with the game by default. These stories are written specifically for this game and are unrelated to eachother.
 After the player reads a "book", as represented in the game, they will be presented with a screen that shows them their statistics for that book. This screen is located in the same room as the player, in game.
 On this report screen, the player will have the option of selecting a word that was determined to have been read incorrectly. This will then read that word aloud, followed by a reading of the spelling of the word and then the word will be read aloud again by the system.
 Similarly, in the practice mode, there will be a screen where the player can select the story they wish to practice with. This screen is located near to the players starting position, to the left.
 The player can then select the story they wish to practice with and then the game will load the story and the player can then practice reading the story.
 Each time the player makes a selection of story to read, the game will read that stories title aloud so the player knows they have chosen the correct story.
 This is to help with the player's reading comprehension. The game will also be displayed on the screen of the computer that the game is being played on.
 This is meant to allow the teacher to see what the student is reading and to help the student with their reading comprehension.
 Some soft music will also play in the background, this can be stopped in game by pressing the button with the image of the Play/Pause icon on it. This is to the left of the book in the room when the player faces the open book.
 If the player does not like the current piece of music, they can skip the piece by pressing the double arrow button to the right of the Play/Pause button.
