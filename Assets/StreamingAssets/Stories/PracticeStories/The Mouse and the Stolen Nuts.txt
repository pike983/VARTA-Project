This is a story about a mouse. This mouse lived in a forest with his family. One of the favourite foods of this mouse is nuts. The mouse would often go searching for nuts in the forest. One day, the mouse had found a few nuts and had a pile to take home. However, as the mouse was returning from collecting another nut, he saw a bird pick up his nuts and fly away. The mouse followed this bird to a tree where the bird was nesting.
Unfortunately for the mouse, he was never very good at climbing. The mouse was determined to get his nuts back though and tried to climb the tree. This was very hard for the mouse though. Every branch was far from the others and the bark was slippery from moss and rain.
The mouse would not give up though and kept trying. The mouse climbed and climbed until he was too tired to climb any more. So, the mouse took a break and had a nap on the branch he had reached. Once he woke up, he continued the climb.
After some more time the mouse finally reached the branch where the bird had put his nuts. The bird was still in its nest though. So, the mouse climbed up one more branch before jumping down next to the bird.
The bird flew away in fright and the mouse had his nuts back. Pushing the nuts off the branch, the mouse finally brought his nuts back home. He was happy to have his nuts, and he did not think the bird would try to take from him again.
The end.
