There was once a man who was always rushing to get to work in the morning. This man would work long hours every day. He would be out from dawn to dusk. This morning though he could not find his keys.
The man was in a panic. To him, this was a very bad thing. He felt that he had to find his keys right away. So, he started to search everywhere in his house for them. Starting at the table where he normally kept his keys, the man searched every drawer.
The keys were not there though. However, while he was searching, he found a picture of his family. The man had not seen his family for a long time. This made him feel sad, but he still wanted to find his keys.
The man moved on from the table, the man started to search everywhere. While he was searching he came across more mementos from his past. He would stop each time for a quick smile or small tear.
Eventually the man had searched everywhere and had not found his keys. Back at his front door the man put his hands on his hips. As the man did this, he felt a ring and heard a soft jingle. Moving the ring up to his face the man saw the keys he had been looking for. They were on his belt the whole time.
Having a small laugh, the man realized that he was working too hard. He was tired from the work and needed to slow down. The man resolved to reduce his hours and go see his family soon.
The end.
