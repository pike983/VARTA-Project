Once upon a time there was a boy who was just starting grade two. This year his parents were busy and would not be able to drive him to school. This meant that the boy would need to take the school bus. This was scary for the boy as he had never taken the school bus before.
The parents tried to reassure the boy that it would be okay. However, the boy could not get past his fear of the unknown. The parents tried everything from playing pretend to instructional videos. Nothing would make the boy feel better though.
Eventually the day came where the boy would have to take the bus for the first time. On the way to the bus stop the boy cried and held his mother's hand. He did not want to go alone.
However, when they got to the bus stop the boy heard his name called. Looking up he saw a friend from school calling him. This surprised the boy since he did not know that his friend took the bus.
Letting go of his mother's hand, the boy went to his friend. He was starting to feel better about taking the bus now but was still a little scared. The boy's friend saw this and told the boy that the bus was fun. In fact, the friend said that they would introduce the boy to some new friends.
The boy did get onto the bus after saying goodbye to his mother and stayed close to his friend. The boy found though that his friend was right. The bus did end up being fun and he met some new friends who also took the bus. From then on, the boy was not scared of the bus anymore.
The end.
